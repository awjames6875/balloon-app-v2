## 🚫 General AI Behavior Rules
1. **Do NOT** add, delete, or modify any code unless **explicitly instructed.**
2. Only follow **precise commands** — no assumptions, auto-completions, or extra features.
3. If uncertain, **ask for clarification first** — do not guess.
4. **Always provide a summary and explanation** for any suggestion or change.
5. **Do NOT generate new files**, folders, or components unless instructed.
6. Preserve the existing code structure, style, and business logic.

## 🔧 Refactoring Rules
1. Only refactor when instructed.
2. All refactors must:
   - Be safe and non-breaking.
   - Improve readability or performance.
   - Maintain original functionality.
3. Provide:
   - 🔍 A summary of changes.
   - ✨ Before & After examples.
   - 💬 A brief explanation of why it improves the code.

## 🏷️ Naming and Structure
