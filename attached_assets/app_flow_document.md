# Balloon App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user first visits the Balloon App, they are welcomed by a simple and minimalistic landing page that clearly explains the purpose of the application. The landing page provides information about how the app streamlines the work of balloon artists and small business owners who manage balloon designs and production. New users can begin by creating an account using an email registration form or by signing in through available social logins such as Google or Facebook if supported. During the sign-up process, users are asked to provide basic details like name, email address, and a secure password. If any user forgets their password, they can click a link on the sign-in page and follow a straightforward password recovery process that typically involves receiving a reset link via email. Signing out is equally simple, with a readily available option visible in the user interface, ensuring that users can log out securely from whichever device they are using.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Once logged in, users are directed to the Main Dashboard which serves as the central hub for all actions within the Balloon App. The dashboard is designed with a clean, minimalistic look, featuring a sidebar that lists the core modules of the application such as Design Upload & Analysis, Inventory Management, Production Planning, Sales Analytics, and Project Management. At the top of the page, users can find additional navigation options including profile settings and notifications. The dashboard immediately presents users with a summary of current inventory levels, pending production forms, and low-inventory alerts, giving them a clear overview of their ongoing activities. Navigation is intuitive and users can easily transition to any detailed module by clicking the corresponding links or icons on the main dashboard.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

The first core module is the Design Upload & Analysis section. In this area, users upload images of balloon designs in formats such as JPEG, PNG, GIF, or WebP. Once an image is uploaded, an AI-powered tool analyzes the design to detect color patterns, identify clusters, and calculate the number of balloons needed. Users then have the possibility to modify the design using natural language commands, for example typing commands like 'change red clusters to 5'. After the analysis and any adjustments are made, the system automatically transfers the updated information to the Production Planning module. Here, users can generate detailed production forms that summarize all the required materials including the quantities of 11-inch and 16-inch balloons, and list any accessories such as LED lights, starbursts, or pearl garlands. In addition, the Inventory Management module keeps track of balloon stocks by color and size. Whenever a design adjustment affects the number of balloons required, the inventory is updated in real time. These modules interconnect smoothly, allowing users to jump from image analysis to production planning without losing context. There is also a section for Project Management where users save client projects, store design images and specifications, and generate historical production summaries. The real-time Sales Analytics Dashboard is directly accessible from the main navigation menu, presenting charts and graphs that display sales revenue, production times, inventory turnover rates, and trends over time. This dashboard automatically pulls data from the backend and updates frequently through API calls, providing users with current business insights.

## Settings and Account Management

In the Settings and Account Management section, users have complete control over their personal and business information. They can update details like their name, email, and password, as well as change preferences for notifications such as automated low-inventory alerts. This section also includes areas for configuring billing and subscription settings for users who engage with integrated payment features like Stripe. Administrative functions are available for users with admin roles as well as for designated roles like Designer and Inventory Manager, ensuring that each type of user can only access features relevant to their role. Once changes are saved, the interface guides the user back to the main dashboard or the section they were previously working in, ensuring a seamless transition back into their workflow without interruption.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

The Balloon App is designed with clear error handling routines to maintain a smooth user experience even when mistakes occur. For example, if a user attempts to upload a design in an unsupported format or if the image does not meet quality requirements, they receive an error message that explains the issue in simple language and suggests corrective actions. Similarly, if there is a loss of connectivity during an operation such as file upload or data update, the app immediately displays a notification informing the user of the disrupted connection along with instructions to try again later. When a user tries to perform an action for which they do not have sufficient permission, they are met with a clear warning that explains the access restrictions and advises on how to obtain the necessary authorization. These error messages are designed to be friendly and constructive, helping users to quickly understand the problem and continue with their tasks once the issue is resolved.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The overall journey in the Balloon App begins with a straightforward onboarding process where users create and secure their accounts, followed by an intuitive sign-in that leads directly to a well-organized Main Dashboard. From the dashboard, users can easily navigate through every stage of their workflow, whether they are uploading and analyzing designs, managing inventory levels, planning production schedules, or checking real-time sales analytics. Each module is designed to transition fluidly into the next, ensuring that any adjustments in design automatically update production forms and inventory records, while the sales dashboard provides ongoing business insights. Even when errors occur or users encounter unexpected situations, clear and helpful messages guide them back onto track. The comprehensive integration of features ensures that from sign-up through daily use, every aspect of the Balloon App is geared toward enhancing efficiency, reducing manual tasks, and empowering balloon artists and small business owners to manage and grow their operations successfully.
