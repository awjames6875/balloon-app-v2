Plan for Adding Balloon Ordering Functionality
I can see from your screenshot that you need a way to order balloons directly from the inventory check dialog. Here's a plan for implementing this feature without writing code yet:

1. Update the "Order More Balloons" Button
Currently, the "Order More Balloons" button in the dialog just redirects users to the inventory page. Instead, we should:

Change it to "Order Missing Balloons" for clarity
Make it open a new order form dialog instead of just navigating away
2. Create a New Order Form Dialog
When clicked, the "Order Missing Balloons" button would open a new dialog with:

Header Section:
Clear title: "Order Balloons for Your Design"
Subtitle explaining what's happening: "We'll add these balloons to your next order"
Order Summary Table:
Show only the rows where balloons are needed (red rows from previous screen)
Include columns for:
Color (with colored dots)
Size (11" or 16")
Current Stock
Amount Needed for Design
Quantity to Order (pre-filled with the difference)
Subtotal Price (based on quantity × unit price)
Order Form Fields:
Supplier dropdown (if there are multiple)
Expected delivery date picker
Priority level (Normal/Rush)
Notes field for special instructions
Total Section:
Show the total quantity being ordered
Show the estimated total cost
Include any applicable shipping/rush fees
Action Buttons:
"Cancel" button to close the dialog
"Save for Later" to save the order without submitting
"Place Order" button to submit the order
3. Order Confirmation Screen
After clicking "Place Order":

Show a confirmation message with the order number
Provide expected delivery timeline
Option to view all pending orders
Option to return to the design
4. Inventory Management Integration
The order would automatically update a "Pending Orders" section in the inventory management page
When balloons arrive, users can mark them as received, which automatically updates inventory quantities
5. Kid-Friendly Elements
To keep it understandable for a 5th grader:

Include a simple explanation at the top: "You need more balloons for your design. Let's order them!"
Use the same visual indicators (❌, ⚠️, ✅) for consistency
Add visual aids like a delivery truck icon for the shipping section
Keep language simple and direct
6. Navigation Flow
User creates design → Saves design → Checks inventory
System shows comparison with missing items highlighted in red
User clicks "Order Missing Balloons"
Order form appears with missing items pre-filled
User reviews, adjusts quantities if needed, and places order
Confirmation appears and order is logged in inventory system
Would you like me to implement this plan? It would create a smooth workflow from identifying missing balloons to ordering exactly what you need.
