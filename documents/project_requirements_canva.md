# Project Requirements Document (Balloon App)

## 1. Project Overview

The Balloon App is a Canva-style web-based platform designed for small to mid-sized businesses in the balloon design industry. The platform streamlines the entire workflow for balloon artistsâ€”from initial design creation through to production planning and inventory management. Using a drag-and-drop interface, users can create custom balloon designs by placing predefined balloon clusters onto uploaded images or blank canvases. The app automatically tracks balloon quantities by size and color.

This application optimizes business operations by merging intuitive design creation with smart inventory tracking and practical production planning. Its key objectives are to simplify the design process, reduce errors in material estimation, streamline production planning with ready-to-use production forms, and provide actionable business insights via a real-time analytics dashboard.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

### In-Scope:

- Canva-style drag-and-drop interface for creating balloon designs by placing predefined balloon clusters onto canvases
- Background image upload support for standard formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- Predefined balloon cluster templates with realistic rendering (no visible numbers)
- Standard cluster composition of 13 balloons (2 x 16-inch and 11 x 11-inch) with multiple preset styles
- Real-time data table showing balloon counts by size and color
- Automatic calculation of material requirements as clusters are added to designs
- Integrated inventory management system to track balloon stocks by color and size
- Production planning tools that generate comprehensive production forms
- Secure user account management with different roles and customizable permissions
- Responsive design ensuring accessibility across devices
- Payment gateway integration (e.g., Stripe) for secure transactions

### Out-of-Scope:

- Integration with external third-party inventory systems
- Multi-language support beyond English (for future updates)
- Extensive customization of branding elements
- Advanced AI-driven product recommendations
- Mobile app native development; focus remains on responsive web platform

## 3. User Flow

A new user begins by signing up with a secure account creation process and selecting a role (Designer, Inventory Manager, or Admin). Once logged in, the user lands on a clean, minimalistic dashboard with a side navigation menu.

From the dashboard, they access the design canvas which features:

- A sidebar containing various predefined balloon cluster templates
- A main canvas area for design composition
- Tools to upload background images
- A color selection palette

Users can drag and drop balloon cluster templates onto the canvas, position them precisely, and customize their colors. As clusters are added, a real-time data table updates to show counts of balloons by size and color. Users can save designs, which automatically updates inventory requirements.

The production planning module then compiles all necessary material requirements and generates a ready-to-use production form. Additionally, users can view a real-time sales analytics dashboard to track key metrics.

## 4. Core Features
