# Project Requirements Document (Balloon App)

## 1. Project Overview

The Balloon App is a web-based platform specifically designed for small to mid-sized businesses in the balloon design industry. The platform streamlines the entire workflow for balloon artists—from the initial design upload and analysis through to production planning and inventory management. Using integrated AI-powered tools, the app automatically analyzes design images to detect colors, patterns, and material requirements. It then computes the exact quantities of different balloon types and accessories needed. This automation enables users to cut down on manual calculations and focus more on creative aspects and customer engagement.

The application is built to optimize business operations by merging design efficiency with smart inventory tracking and practical production planning. Its key objectives are to reduce errors in material estimation, simplify production planning with ready-to-use production forms, and provide actionable business insights via a real-time sales analytics dashboard. In essence, the success of the project hinges on improved workflow efficiency, better inventory control, and enhanced decision-making through integrated data reporting.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   AI-powered analysis of uploaded balloon design images for identifying color patterns and estimating balloon quantities.
*   A design module allowing users to input specifications (dimensions, client details, style preferences, etc.) and automatically calculate material requirements.
*   An integrated inventory management system to track balloon stocks by color and size, automatically update records, and send alerts when stock is low.
*   Production planning tools that generate comprehensive production forms with details of required materials, accessories (like LED lights, starbursts, and garlands), and estimated production time.
*   Interactive design assistant features that let users modify designs using natural language commands, with real-time recalculations.
*   A real-time sales analytics dashboard that pulls data from the backend (Supabase) to track key business metrics with charts and graphs.
*   Secure user account management with different roles (admin, designer, inventory manager) and customizable permissions.
*   Responsive design to ensure accessibility on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
*   Integration with popular payment gateways (e.g., Stripe) for secure transactions.
*   Comprehensive user support documentation including manuals, video tutorials, in-app help, and customer support channels.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Integration with external third-party inventory systems beyond the built-in system.
*   Multi-language support beyond English (to be considered for future updates).
*   Extensive customization of branding elements beyond a clean, minimalistic interface with neutral colors and clear navigation.
*   Advanced AI-driven product recommendations as a primary feature (labeled as optional) and additional AI-driven suggestions beyond the basic integration.
*   Mobile app native development; the focus remains on a responsive web platform.

## 3. User Flow

A new user begins by signing up using a secure account creation process and selecting a role (e.g., Designer, Inventory Manager, or Admin). Once logged in, the user lands on a clean, minimalistic dashboard that features a side navigation menu. From the dashboard, they can easily access the design upload screen where they can submit balloon design images and enter project details such as client information, dimensions, and style preferences. The interface also provides a color management system that limits the selection to exactly four colors as required for each design.

After a design is uploaded, the AI-powered analysis engine automatically processes the image. It detects color patterns, calculates the number of required clusters, and determines balloon quantities for both 11" and 16" sizes. Users then have the ability to interact with the design assistant by typing in commands to adjust design elements (for instance, “change red clusters to 5”). Upon confirmation, the system dynamically updates the production form. The production planning module then compiles all necessary material requirements, along with accessory needs, and generates a ready-to-use production form that serves as the final guide for production and inventory management. Additionally, users can view a real-time sales analytics dashboard to track key metrics like sales revenue, production statistics, and inventory status.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:**

    *   The platform should respond to user interactions with minimal delay. Typical response times for API calls (e.g., to Supabase) and data processing should be under 2-3 seconds.
    *   Image analysis and design recalculations should complete promptly for good user experience.

*   **Security:**

    *   Ensure secure authentication and access control by using Supabase’s auth capabilities.
    *   Secure image uploads and data transactions (SSL/TLS) must be implemented.
    *   Data privacy standards and best practices (such as proper handling of user data) must be observed.

*   **Usability:**

    *   The interface will follow a clean, minimalistic design with intuitive navigation.
    *   The application must maintain consistency across devices (responsive design), making it equally usable on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

*   **Compliance:**

    *   Basic compliance with data protection regulations relevant to the regions the application operates in.

*   **Scalability:**

    *   The app should efficiently handle increasing numbers of users, transactions, and design uploads, scaling both frontend and backend as needed.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   **AI Models Availability:**

    *   The system depends on GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet for AI-driven features. It is assumed that these models are reliably available and integrated seamlessly.

*   **Supabase as Backend:**

    *   The platform relies on Supabase for database, storage, and authentication services. Its API rate limits and performance must be taken into account.

*   **File Formats:**

    *   Although the app supports various image formats, optimal results are achieved with clear JPEG or PNG images.

*   **Device Compatibility:**

    *   The design assumes users will access the platform via desktops, tablets, and mobile browsers; hence, responsiveness is essential.

*   **User Roles and Permissions:**

    *   Assumes a well-defined hierarchy for user roles (Admin, Designer, Inventory Manager) with clearly segmented privileges.

*   **Future Enhancements:**

    *   Multi-language support and additional branding customization are slated for future iterations and are not part of the initial release.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **API Rate Limits:**

    *   When using Supabase for real-time analytics or handling numerous API calls simultaneously, there might be concerns regarding rate limits. Mitigation may include caching strategies and efficient query management.

*   **Image Processing Delays:**

    *   High-resolution image uploads could lead to processing delays. It is vital to optimize images during upload and possibly set a recommended file size for optimal performance.

*   **Dependency on Third-Party Tools:**

    *   The integration with external AI models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) introduces dependencies. Any downtime or changes in these models’ APIs could affect functionality.

*   **Cross-Device Compatibility:**

    *   Although a responsive design is a priority, there is always the risk of minor display issues across various devices and browsers. Rigorous testing on multiple devices is essential.

*   **User Role Misconfigurations:**

    *   Incorrectly setting or handling permissions among roles (Designer vs. Inventory Manager vs. Admin) could lead to unauthorized modifications. Clear role definitions and validations in the backend will help prevent this.

*   **Error Handling for Automated Alerts:**

    *   Incorrectly set inventory thresholds or errors in automated alerts (email/SMS) might confuse users. Implementing fail-safes and clear logging will be crucial.
