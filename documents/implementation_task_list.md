# Balloon Design Studio - Implementation Task List

## Application Flow Requirements
- The workflow must follow Design → Inventory → Production path (not Design → Production directly)
- Production form generation should happen from the inventory page only when sufficient supplies are available
- Enhanced inventory verification acts as a gateway to production

## Removal of AI Features Task List

### Design Page
- [x] Remove "DesignAnalysis" import from design.tsx
- [x] Update DesignUploader props to remove analysis references
- [x] Rename handleAnalysisStart to handleUploadStart
- [x] Change button text from "Upload & Analyze Design" to "Upload Design"
- [x] Update loading text from "Analyzing..." to "Uploading..."
- [x] Remove unused DesignUploader reference from design.tsx as it's been replaced by BackgroundUploader
