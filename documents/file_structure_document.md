# File Structure Document

## Introduction

A well-organized file structure is the backbone of this Balloon App, a web-based platform designed to boost the efficiency of balloon artists in tasks ranging from design analysis to production planning. This document explains how the files and directories are organized to support smooth development, easy collaboration, and scalable growth. By having a clear structure, everyone involved—from developers to non-technical stakeholders—can understand where each piece of the project fits into the overall puzzle.

## Overview of the Tech Stack

This project is built using a modern tech stack that includes Next.js 14 and TypeScript on the frontend. Tailwind CSS provides a clean and responsive design, while shadcn/UI, Radix UI, and Lucide Icons help create a cohesive and interactive user interface. On the backend, Supabase manages database operations, authentication, and storage functions. In addition, optional AI integrations with GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet add smart design analysis features. Tools like Replit, Lovable, and bolt.new facilitate rapid development and prototyping. The chosen technologies significantly influence the file organization by separating frontend components, backend integrations, configuration files, and documentation into distinct areas for clarity and maintenance.

## Root Directory Structure

The root directory is thoughtfully organized into several main folders and files, each with a specific role in the project. At the highest level, you will find core configuration files such as package.json, tsconfig.json, and next.config.js that are essential for managing dependencies, TypeScript settings, and Next.js custom configurations. The public folder contains static assets like images and icons, which in this case may include design samples or UI assets for balloon designs. The src folder serves as the central hub for the application code, housing all pages, components, hooks, utilities, and API service integrations by Supabase and optional AI modules. Additionally, directories such as docs, tests, and scripts provide dedicated space for documentation, automated tests, and deployment scripts. Separating these concerns improves clarity, making it easier for team members to navigate the project without ambiguity.

## Configuration and Environment Files

Configuration and environment files play a critical role in setting up and running the application across different environments. Files like .env and .env.local store environment-specific variables including Supabase keys, API endpoints, and configuration secrets required for authentication and storage settings. The next.config.js file customizes the Next.js framework to suit the project’s unique needs, such as optimizing images and handling specific build options. In addition, tsconfig.json ensures that the TypeScript compiler settings remain consistent across development environments. Package.json not only lists dependencies but also scripts that kick off development, testing, and production builds, tying together the various technologies involved in the project.

## Documentation Structure

Documentation is organized in its own dedicated folder named docs at the root level. This directory contains comprehensive guides and resources such as user manuals, video tutorial scripts, and interactive FAQs. The structure is designed to serve both technical users and end-users, ensuring that quality assurance and ongoing support are readily available. Within the docs folder, files are clearly named to separate onboarding guides from developer documentation, API references, and design documentation. This organization supports easy knowledge sharing and quick access to information, whether someone is learning the system or troubleshooting a specific feature.

## Conclusion and Overall Summary

In summary, the file structure of the Balloon App is intentionally designed to support efficient development, simplify collaboration, and ensure scalability. The separation of frontend components, backend integrations, configuration settings, and documentation into clear directories makes the project easy to understand and maintain. Unique aspects such as dedicated folders for AI integrations and detailed module-specific configurations set this project apart, ensuring that every team member can find what they need quickly. The organized structure not only improves daily development tasks but also lays a strong foundation for future growth and enhancements.
