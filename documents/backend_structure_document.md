# Backend Structure Document

This document provides a detailed overview of the backend setup for the Balloon App. It explains the overall backend architecture, the database management strategy, API design, hosting solutions, infrastructure components, security measures, and how the system is monitored and maintained. The goal is to clearly explain each part of the backend, making it accessible even to non-technical stakeholders.

## 1. Backend Architecture

The backend of the Balloon App is designed with modern serverless principles and cloud-native services. It is built to handle real-time data processing and support dynamic features like AI-powered design analysis and live updates to dashboards.

*   **Serverless Approach with Supabase:** The backend primarily uses Supabase, which provides a managed PostgreSQL database, authentication, and storage solutions. This reduces the need for traditional server management and allows the team to focus on app functionality.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** The architecture is designed to separate components such as user management, inventory tracking, design processing, and reporting. This modular design improves scalability and maintenance.
*   **Integration with AI Tools:** For tasks such as design analysis and natural language processing, integration with AI models (like GPT-4 or Anthropic's Sonnet 3.5) is handled through secure API calls from the backend. This ensures that computationally intensive tasks are offloaded appropriately.
*   **Modern Design Patterns:** The system employs common design patterns like Model-View-Controller (MVC) where the backend focuses on data models and business logic, while front-end frameworks manage user interface aspects.

## 2. Database Management

The Balloon App uses a robust database management system provided by Supabase, which is built on PostgreSQL. This choice offers several benefits:

*   **Relational (SQL) Database:** Utilizing PostgreSQL ensures reliable data integrity, complex queries, and transactional support.
*   **Structured Storage:** Data is organized into clearly defined tables for users, designs, inventory, and production reports. This facilitates easy retrieval and efficient storage.
*   **Supabase Storage Services:** In addition to database storage, image assets (like design uploads) are stored using Supabase's integrated storage solution. This provides a streamlined way to handle file uploads and access control.
*   **Scalability and Performance:** As demand grows, Supabase’s managed services ensure easy scalability and consistent performance without the need for manual scaling of the underlying database.

## 3. Database Schema

### Human Readable Overview

*   **Users Table:** Contains records of all users with fields for user ID, username, email, password hash, and role (such as admin, designer, or inventory manager).
*   **Designs Table:** Stores all design-related data including design ID, user ID (who uploaded the design), design images, metadata about the design (colors, clusters), and timestamps.
*   **Inventory Table:** Tracks all inventory items (balloon stocks) with fields like inventory ID, color, size, quantity on hand, threshold value for low-inventory alerts, and timestamps for updates.
*   **Reports Table:** Keeps logs of generated reports (sales, inventory, production) including report ID, user ID, type of report, export status (CSV export), and generation timestamps.

### Sample SQL Schema (for PostgreSQL)

Below is an example that outlines the main tables:

-- Users Table CREATE TABLE users ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, username VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL, email VARCHAR(150) UNIQUE NOT NULL, password_hash TEXT NOT NULL, role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- e.g., admin, designer, inventory_manager created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );

-- Designs Table CREATE TABLE designs ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id), image_url TEXT NOT NULL, metadata JSONB, -- stores design analysis results: colors, cluster details, etc. created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );

-- Inventory Table CREATE TABLE inventory ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, color VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, size VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL, -- e.g., 11", 16" quantity INTEGER NOT NULL, threshold INTEGER NOT NULL, -- value to trigger low-inventory alerts updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );

## -- Reports Table CREATE TABLE reports ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id), report_type VARCHAR(50), -- e.g., sales, inventory, production file_url TEXT, -- URL for CSV export generated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );

## 4. API Design and Endpoints

The API layer is designed to provide a smooth interaction between the frontend and backend, using RESTful principles on top of Supabase’s PostgREST capabilities. Key points include:

*   **RESTful Endpoints:** Each key function of the app (user authentication, design submission, inventory updates, report generation) has been mapped to an endpoint. This enables standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for operations.

*   **Key Endpoints Include:**

    *   /auth: For user login, signup, and authentication management.
    *   /designs: To handle uploading, updating, and retrieving design data.
    *   /inventory: To manage inventory records, update quantities, and fetch low-stock items.
    *   /reports: For generating and downloading various reports, including CSV exports.
    *   /analytics: To serve data for the real-time sales dashboard.

*   **AI Integration Endpoints:** Special endpoints are provided to interface with the external AI services for design analysis and interactive design commands, ensuring that data is securely passed to and from AI models.

## 5. Hosting Solutions

*   **Supabase Hosting and Managed Services:** The core backend services are hosted on Supabase. This platform offers managed hosting for the PostgreSQL database, authentication, and file storage. It simplifies the process of scaling the backend as the user base grows.
*   **Cost-Effective and Reliable:** Supabase’s infrastructure provides a reliable, secure, and cost-effective solution without the overhead of configuring dedicated servers.
*   **Edge Functions:** Some dynamic backend functions may use serverless edge functions, which provide low latency and are scalable on-demand.

## 6. Infrastructure Components

The overall infrastructure includes several key components that work together to ensure optimal performance and a quality user experience:

*   **Load Balancers:** These are used to distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers or functions, ensuring that no single component is overwhelmed.
*   **Caching Mechanisms:** Caching is used to store frequently accessed data (e.g., design metadata, inventory snapshots) which speeds up response times.
*   **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):** Supabase, along with other integrated hosting services, uses CDNs to quickly deliver static files such as images and design assets to users across the globe.
*   **Serverless Edge Functions:** These functions process real-time logic (like AI requests) and dynamic content serving, further reducing latency.

## 7. Security Measures

The security of user data and system operations is a major focus. The following measures are implemented:

*   **Authentication & Authorization:** Leveraging Supabase’s built-in Auth services ensures that users are securely authenticated. Role-based access ensures that only authorized individuals can perform sensitive actions.
*   **Data Encryption:** All data transferred between the client and server is encrypted via HTTPS. Sensitive information, such as password hashes and payment details, are stored securely.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** The backend infrastructure undergoes regular security reviews to ensure compliance with industry standards and to mitigate emerging threats.
*   **Use of Environment Variables:** Secret keys and credentials are stored securely using environment variables and are never hard-coded in public repositories.

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

To ensure the platform remains robust and performs well, several monitoring and maintenance practices are in place:

*   **Performance Monitoring Tools:** Tools (such as Supabase's built-in monitoring as well as external services like Sentry) are used to continuously monitor application performance and detect issues.
*   **Error Logging:** All errors and exceptions are logged so that developers can quickly isolate and address any failures in the system.
*   **Scheduled Backups:** Regular automatic backups of the PostgreSQL database ensure data recovery and continuity in case of unexpected incidents.
*   **Maintenance Windows:** Regular maintenance schedules are established to update dependencies and apply security patches without impacting active users.
